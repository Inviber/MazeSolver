# MazeSolver

## Description
A GUI application written in Python using Tkinter that creates a matrix of with a number of rows and columns established. Then would 
dynamically create a maze of the matrix based of a random seed generated at creation of the window. To determine what walls would break
to create the routes for the maze, depth-first travesal was used. For solving the maze, a depth-first travesal solution was used and the GUI
would be updated with a red line for the correct route and grey for a route that was taken, but was incorrect.

## Start Up Applcation
